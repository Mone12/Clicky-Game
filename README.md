# Clicky Game

Have a good memory? Then you should be really good at this game. This Sailor Moon themed Clicky Game is a memory game that requires you to click every image without clicking on the same image twice. 


## Usage
Clicky Game is deployed through Heroku. To access the app, click the link here:https://guarded-brushlands-57806.herokuapp.com/.

Click any image to begin the game.

Your score will start being counted once you click an image as well as your highscore.

To test your memory on which images were already clicked, the images will shuffle at random each time you click them. 

You score one point for every click which will be added on the score board in the nav bar. If you click the same image twice, you will lose and your score will go back down to zero with your new high score displayed.
